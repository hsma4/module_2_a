    "You'll see above that we imported two libraries - the `random` library, and the `math` library.  However, the code won't execute until we instruct it.  To do this, click in the code cell that we want to run.  Then, either click the **Play** button in the top toolbar, or hit CTRL + Enter at the same time.  Once the code has executed, you'll see a number in the square brackets next to the code block.  This number indicates the order in which you ran things - this is important, because in a Jupyter Notebook you can run code blocks in any order you choose.  If this is the first time you've run the code block above in your current session, you should see the number 1 appear.  If you run the code again, you'll see it's replaced with the number 2.\n",

    "Now, let's have another code block where we use the libraries we've imported above.  In this next block of code, we'll first randomly generate two numbers - one a floating point number (number with a decimal point) between 0 and 1, and one an integer (whole number) between 1 and 10.  Then we'll add them together, and use a function of the `math` library called `ceil` which returns the \"ceiling\" of a number (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number).  Finally we print a message confirming that we've used this to calculate how many nurses we need, and therefore how many we need to employ (since we can only have whole numbers of people)."

This will restart the Kernel (as you did in Spyder) and clear all the outputs from your notebook, to start \"afresh\" (This is also useful because, when you save a Notebook, it saves in its current state (complete with the outputs you had at the time of saving).
